Welcome to the prototype Transformers TCG Deck Editor.

In order to run the program:

The file TransformersTCG_Deck_Builder.py is the main file and should be run to interact with the program.
The file Transformers_Card_Data.py contains the card data and needs to be in the same directory as the main file
The .gif image files contain the card images and must be in the same directory as the main file
